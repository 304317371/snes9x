*PSP Version of Snes9X*
Name: Snes9X Euphoria
Latest version: R5 Beta
Homepage/forum: http://www.retroemu.com/forum/
Maintainer: Zack

HOW TO GET IT RUNNING:
1. Make sure your PSP is hackable in some way. This means:
* PSP-1000 series and certain PSP-2000 series (Google for compatibility) can use Pandora Battery
* PSP-2000 series that can't be Pandoraized (Google for compatibility), most PSP-3000 series, and PSP Gos are hackable via other means (DaveeFTW Downgrader, etc)

2. Make sure your PSP has custom firmware or a HEN that's useable (you'll have to upgrade/downgrade the firmware as necessary). Google for these CFWs, HENs, and installations. (Hint: I personally prefer 5.50 GEN-D3 on the Pandora-able PSPs; 6.20 or 6.35 PRO-B4 or better on the non-Pandora-able PSPs.)

3. When that's done, be sure to put the Snes9X Euphoria in /PSP/GAME on your PSP's memory stick or internal memory (PSP Go only).

*Wii/Gamecube version of Snes9X*
Name: Snes9X GX
Latest Version: 4.2.7
Homepage/forum: http://code.google.com/p/snes9x-gx
Maintainer: Tantric

HOW TO GET IT RUNNING:
Wii: You will need the latest Homebrew Channel installed on your Wii. Use Google for installation instructions and to find the HBC.
In addition, there appears to be a channel for Snes9X GX; again, use Google for installation instructions.
Gamecube: You might need a modchip; search Google.

*Android and iOS (Apple iPhone/iPod touch) version of Snes9X*
Name: Snes9X EX
Latest Version: 1.3.22
Homepage/forum: http://www.explusalpha.com/home/snes9x-ex
Maintainer: Rakashazi (on the Snes9X forums)

HOW TO GET IT RUNNING:
Android: It appears you can just download from the Android app-store thingy and run it from there :)
iOS: You'll have to jailbreak your firmware (use Google) and install the Cydia app installer. Then you'll have to install the BigBoss repository within Cydia and search for Snes9X EX; you may also want to search for the sshd and all needed stuff for that, as it's the only way you can put the ROMs onto your iPhone/iPod Touch. After that you should be able to download and run from there :)

*Second Android version of Snes9X*
Name: Snesoid
Latest Version: unknown
Homepage/forum: www.snes9x.com/phpbb2

*PS3 version of Snes9X*
Name: Snes9X PS3
Latest Version: 4.4.9
Homepage/forum: https://code.google.com/p/snes9x-ps3/ (although for some reason, you may have to Google for the latest version)
Maintainer: Squarepusher

HOW TO GET IT RUNNING:
You'll have to install a HEN/Jailbreaker/CFW/etc on your PS3 (use Google for more information).
After that, it should be as simple as copy the emulator/ROMs over to the PS3 and it should work :)
