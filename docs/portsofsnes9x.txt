*PSP Version of Snes9X*
Name: Snes9X Euphoria
Latest version: R5 Beta
Homepage/forum: http://www.retroemu.com/forum/
Maintainer: Zack

HOW TO GET IT RUNNING:
*DISCLAIMER* You will have to do some Googling, including but not limited to:
* Downgrading/upgrading your firmware
* Checking if your PSP-2000 series can use Pandora's Battery
* Checking if your PSP-3000 series can use the DaveeFTW Downgrader
* Creating Pandora's Battery
* Finding the hacks, HENs, CFWs, etc and how to use/install them

1. Make sure your PSP is hackable in some way. This means:
* PSP-1000 series and certain PSP-2000 series can use Pandora Battery
* PSP-2000 series that can't use Pandora Battery, most PSP-3000 series, and PSP
Gos are hackable via other means (DaveeFTW Downgrader, etc)

2. Make sure your PSP has custom firmware or a HEN that's useable (you'll have
to upgrade/downgrade the firmware as necessary). (Hint: I personally prefer
5.50 GEN-D3 on the Pandora-able PSPs; 6.20 or 6.35 PRO-B4 or better on the
non-Pandora-able PSPs.)

3. When that's done, be sure to put the Snes9X Euphoria in /PSP/GAME on your
PSP's memory stick or internal memory (PSP Go only).

*Android and iOS (Apple iPhone/iPod touch) version of Snes9X*
Name: Snes9X EX
Latest Version: 1.3.22
Homepage/forum: http://www.explusalpha.com/home/snes9x-ex
Maintainer: Rakashazi (on the Snes9X forums)

HOW TO GET IT RUNNING:
*DISCLAIMER* You will have to do some Googling, including but not limited to:
* iOS (iPhone/iPod Touch) ONLY!!!: Jailbreaking your firmware

Android: It appears you can just download from the Android app-store thingy and
run it from there :)
iOS: You'll have to jailbreak your firmware and install the Cydia app
installer. Then you'll have to install the BigBoss repository within Cydia and
search for Snes9X EX; you may also want to search for the sshd and all needed
stuff for that, as it's the only way you can put the ROMs onto your iPhone/iPod
Touch. After that you should be able to download and run from there :)

*PS3 version of Snes9X*
Name: Snes9X PS3
Latest Version: 4.4.9
Homepage/forum: https://code.google.com/p/snes9x-ps3/ (although for some
reason, you may have to Google for the latest version)
Maintainer: Squarepusher

HOW TO GET IT RUNNING:
You'll have to install a HEN/Jailbreaker/CFW/etc on your PS3 (use Google for
more information). After that, it should be as simple as copy the emulator/ROMs
over to the PS3 and it should work :)
